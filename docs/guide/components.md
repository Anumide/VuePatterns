# Components

Components are the building blocks of Vue applications. They are reusable pieces of code that can be used to create different UI elements. Components can be nested to create complex layouts, and they can be combined to create new components.

The components page will contain a comprehensive list of Vue components. The components will be categorized by their functionality / category, and each component will have a detailed description. The page will also include examples of how to use the components and if possible demo within this reference. This page will be a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about Vue components and build up on existing patterns for new components they will be building.

::: info
If a components has different methods of implementation existing on the reference, subsequent methods will be explained in detail below the previous method.
